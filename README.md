# rag_strategy_guide
The rag_strategy_guide repository documents a complete case study in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), demonstrating how to transform a general-purpose Large Language Model (LLM) into a deeply reliable, domain-specific expert.  This project tackles the core limitation of modern foundation models—their tendency to hallucinate or lack knowledge on niche, proprietary, or recent subjects—by grounding all generated answers in a verifiable, user-provided knowledge base.  The resulting artifact is a working, production-ready RAG chatbot prototype specialized in [Your Chosen Topic/Knowledge Base Here], complete with a framework for systematic RAG pipeline evaluation.
