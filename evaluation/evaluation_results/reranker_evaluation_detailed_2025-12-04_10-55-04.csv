I decided to check out the lighthouse and\ncrow’s nest first.', 'Quick Guide to Myst Island\n9. Go outside to the Pillar Garden\nand click on the Leaf, Snake\nand Insect markers. (Each\ninsignia turns green when “on.”)\nYou’ll hear a rushing of water as\nboth the boat model in the basin\nand the actual boat by the dock\nrise up and float.\n10. Go down to the dock, board the\nboat, and enter the aft cabin\ncompartment. You’ll find the\nStoneship Age transport book.\n11. Click on the book to open it and\nactivate the flyby animation,\nthen click on the pic-\nture to transport to\nthe Stoneship Age.\nStoneship Age\n1. Go to the umbrella crow’s nest.

First, activate the Marker Switches at these four locations on\nthe island: dock, sunken gear, spaceship, and log cabin. (You\nneed to turn on all eight Marker Switches to complete Myst,\nbut these four are the only ones necessary for transportation to\nother Ages.)\n2. Go to the Map. Click & hold on the tower icon (flashing con-\ncentric circles) at the Map’s far right. This activates a white\nbeam which swings in an arc around the Map.\n3. Notice that the beam turns red when it passes over the four\nicons that correspond to the four locations mentioned previ-\nously. Release the mouse button when the beam turns red—for\nexample, over the spaceship icon. You’ll hear the tower rotate\nuntil the viewing slot faces the location represented by the icon\non the Map—in this case, the spaceship on its launch pad.\n4.']",The Dimensional Imager is located inside The Dock Forechamber.,"
                        The Dock Forechamber contains a device called the Dimensional Imager.

                        You can interact with the Dimensional Imager in several ways:
                        1.  Open the front cover: The control panel for the Imager is located on the wall by the exit. You need to click on the button at the upper left of this control panel to open the front cover of the Imager.
                        2.  Enter specific codes: Once the cover is open, you can enter three specific codes listed on the cover of the panel: 40, 47, and 67. After entering a code, you can view the corresponding images by pressing the button on the front of the Imager itself.
                        3.  View an additional 3-D image: There's a special image you can view by entering the number of Marker Switches found on the island. While you could count them yourself, the guide tells us there are **8** Marker Switches. So, you can enter ""08"" into the Imager's control panel to view this additional 3-D image, which allows you to ""meet Atrus.""
